#Simple Mp3 Player using DFPlayer Mini

This is a simple Library that supports connecting to a DFPlayer Mini and controlling it via the Serial interface.

The status updates from the DFPlayer (e.g. track play finished) is done via callback functions.

Unfortunately the documentation for DFPlayer a.k.a. ESP8266 is incomplete and partly wrong. Therefore many thanks to *Yerke* from http://forum.banggood.com/forum-topic-59997.html for more insight into the commands of DFPlayer.
